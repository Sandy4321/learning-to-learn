# Neural network learning from canonicalized feature representations

This repository contains 3 folders:

### 1. Data
This is where your toy data sets will be saved to and loaded from.

### 2. Notebooks
This folder contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for various small tasks,
such as synthesizing the artificial dataset and wrangling the data once created.

### 3. Scripts
This folder contains Python scripts for running the core experiments. Here you
will find code for training a neural network model and evaluating its
performance.
