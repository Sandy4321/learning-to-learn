# Neural network learning of object categories from canonicalized feature representations

In this project, we train a neural network on artificial toy data for the task
of object recognition. Each sample in the dataset is represented by a shape,
color and texture value. The repository contains 3 folders:

### 1. Data
This is where the artificial toy data sets will be saved to and loaded from.

### 2. Notebooks
This folder contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for various small tasks,
such as synthesizing the artificial data sets and wrangling the data once
synthesized.

### 3. Scripts
This folder contains Python scripts for running the core experiments. Here you
will find code for training a neural network model and evaluating its
performance.
