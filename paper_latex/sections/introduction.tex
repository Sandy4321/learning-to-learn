\section{Introduction}

Human children possess the remarkable capability to learn a new concept from just one or a
handful of examples. A child can easily learn... [].
In contrast, the best artificial learning systems require many thousands of examples
in order to effectively learn simple concepts.
%Although human behavioral studies offer ample evidence
%of inductive biases, little is known about how these biases are implemented
%in biological information processing systems.

    same shape, and thus option 2 above is likely the right answer. This
    inductive bias helps with future word learning.}
