\section{The Onset of Vocabulary Acceleration}
\label{sec:vocab_accel}
Our previous experiments confirm that simple neural networks can develop the shape
bias when presented with realistic human-sized training sets. It remains unclear,
however, how the development of this bias influences word learning in these
networks. \cite{GershkoffStowe2004} showed that the development of the shape bias
in infants is correlated with the onset of vocabulary accceleration. TODO: continue...
